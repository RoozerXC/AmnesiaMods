# RoozerXC's mods for Amnesia: The Dark Descent
Just a collection of all the mods that I've made for Amnesia: The Dark Descent over the years. Most of them are unfinished

# How to install them
For custom stories:
1. Place all folders from `custom_stories` into your own `custom_stories` folder
2. Open Amnesia using the Steam, GOG Galaxy or Epic Games launcher(s), or from the `NoSteam`/DRM-free executable
3. Select or create a profile, then go to Custom Story
4. All custom stories should be shown and playable in the list, meaning they were all installed properly

For full conversion mods:
1. Place all folders from `full_conversions` into your own Amnesia install folder
2. Go to one of the folders from the list above
3. Click on the `bat` (Windows) or `sh` (Linux) file to launch the mod(s)
