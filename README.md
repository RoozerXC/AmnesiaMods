# How to install them
For custom stories:

2. Open Amnesia using the Steam, GOG Galaxy or Epic Games launcher(s), or from the `NoSteam`/DRM-free executable
3. Select or create a profile, then go to Custom Story
4. All custom stories should be shown and playable as shown from the list above, meaning they were all installed properly

For full conversion mods:
