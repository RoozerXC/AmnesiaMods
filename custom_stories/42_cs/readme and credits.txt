This is an unfinished version of a recent Amnesia mod project i've been working on. If you have debug mode enabled you can go to the custom story's maps folder and switch to all the maps this custom story has. Some of the maps are bare bones and dont work properly because this is an unfinished build. Glhf, and enjoy

-= SHOUTOUTS =-

Tony/Winter - for making my life extremely better during the development of this mod. Without Tony/Winter and her support, this mod would've been really stressful to create and my life would also be a living hell. Tysm for giving some love to me and my creations/etc! It means a lot to me...
*sobs in happiness*

Wrecx/Wrench - because he's the only wrench in the world

Krole - for improving some of my maps and helping me with lighting and stuff

-= OTHER SHOUTOUTS =-

Avenged Sevenfold, A Day To Remember, Blue Stahli, Breaking Benjamin, and ExileLord - for making me jam along with most of their songs during development

BenGNZ - Uses Debian and played Monkey Quest and Club Penguin. Also beta tested one of my cancelled games, and made a DECORATE (read: https://zdoom.org/wiki/DECORATE) torch in GZDoom with my help.

Image-Line - for the very useful FL Studio, used to make some really cool music for this mod
