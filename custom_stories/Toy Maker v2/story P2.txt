Another area was open.

This time it was a hall of stone walls, and then when I came to another teddy bear with red eyes, a jumpscare appeared again.

It restarted me to where I was at before I walked over.

I walked beside the teddy bear with red eyes and there was no jumpscare.

I felt like I was stuck, and there was no way out. I exited the game myself by pressing ALT+F4 or killing the EXE in Task Manager.

I was done playing this game. I have had enough of this.
